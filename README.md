## Time Complexity of Compressing using Huffman encoding is : 
#### O(n log(n)) //Where n is the number of characters in the original text
## Time Complexity of Decompressing the huffman codes is :
#### O(n log (m)), where n is the size of the compressed text and m is the number of unique characters in the original text.
