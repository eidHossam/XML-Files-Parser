## Time Complexity of Compressing using Huffman encoding is : 
#### O(nlog(n)) //Where n is the number of ``distinct`` characters in the origianl text
## Time Complexity of Decompressing the huffman codes is :
#### O(n*k), where n is the size of the compressed text(Compressed size), k is the number of ``distinct`` characters in the original text
